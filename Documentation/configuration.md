# rkt configuration

`rkt` reads configuration from two directories - a **system directory** and a
**local directory**. The system directory defaults to `/usr/lib/rkt` and the
local directory `/etc/rkt`, but both can be overridden via command-line flags.

`rkt` looks for configuration files inside subdirectories of these two
directories. It ignores everything but regular files with `.json` extension.
This means `rkt` does _not_ search for the files by recursively going down
the directory tree. This also means that users are free to put some additional
files there (e.g. documentation).

Every configuration file has two common fields: `rktKind` and
`rktVersion`. Both are strings, and the rest of the fields are specified by
that pair. The currently supported kinds and versions are described below.
These fields must be specified and cannot be empty.

`rktKind` describes the type of the configuration. This is to avoid putting
unrelated values into single monolithic file.

`rktVersion` allows configuration versioning for each kind of configuration. A
new version should be introduced when doing some backward-incompatible changes:
for example, when removing a field or incompatibly changing its semantics. When
a new field is added, a default value should be specified for it, documented,
and used when the field is absent in file. This way, an older version of `rkt`
can work with newer-but-compatible versions of configuration files, and newer
versions of `rkt` can still work with older versions of configuration files.

The configuration in the system directory can be overridden by configuration
in the local directory. The semantics of configuration override are specific to
the kind and version of the configuration file and are described below.
Filenames do not play any role in overriding.

## Configuration kinds

### rktKind: `auth`

This kind of configuration is used to set up necessary credentials
when downloading images and signatures. The configuration files should
be placed inside the `auth.d` subdirectory (e.g., in the case of the default
system/local directories, in `/usr/lib/rkt/auth.d` and/or `/etc/rkt/auth.d`).

#### rktVersion: `v1`

##### Description and examples

This version of `auth` configuration specifies three additional fields:
`domains`, `type` and `credentials`.

The `domains` field is an array of strings describing hosts for which the
following credentials should be used. Each entry must consist of a host/port
combination in a URL as specified by RFC 3986. This field must be specified and
cannot be empty.

The `type` field describes the type of credentials to be sent. This field must
be specified and cannot be empty.

The `credentials` field is defined by the `type` field. It should hold all
the data that are needed for successful authentication with the given hosts.

This version of auth configuration supports two methods - basic HTTP
authentication and OAuth Bearer Token.

Basic HTTP authentication requires two things - a user and a password. To use
this type, define `type` as `basic` and the `credentials` field as a map
with two keys - `user` and `password`. These fields must be specified and
cannot be empty. For example:

```json
{
	"rktKind": "auth",
	"rktVersion": "v1",
	"domains": ["coreos.com", "tectonic.com"],
	"type": "basic",
	"credentials": {
		"user": "foo",
		"password": "bar"
	}
}
```

OAuth Bearer Token authentication requires only a token. To use this type,
define `type` as `oauth` and the `credentials` field as a map with only one
key - `token`. This field must be specified and cannot be empty. For example:

```json
{
	"rktKind": "auth",
	"rktVersion": "v1",
	"domains": ["coreos.com", "tectonic.com"],
	"type": "oauth",
	"credentials": {
		"token": "sometoken"
	}
}
```

##### Override semantics

Overriding is done for each domain. That means that the user can override
authentication type and/or credentials used for each domain. As an example,
consider this system configuration:

`/usr/lib/rkt/auth.d/coreos.json`:

```json
{
	"rktKind": "auth",
	"rktVersion": "v1",
	"domains": ["coreos.com", "tectonic.com", "kubernetes.io"],
	"type": "oauth",
	"credentials": {
		"token": "common-token"
	}
}
```

If only this configuration file is provided then when downloading data from
either `coreos.com`, `tectonic.com` or `kubernetes.io`, `rkt` would send an
HTTP header of: `Authorization: Bearer common-token`.

But with additional configuration provided in the local configuration
directory, this can be overridden. For example, given the above system
configuration and the following local configurations:

`/etc/rkt/auth.d/specific-coreos.json`:

```json
{
	"rktKind": "auth",
	"rktVersion": "v1",
	"domains": ["coreos.com"],
	"type": "basic",
	"credentials": {
		"user": "foo",
		"password": "bar"
	}
}
```

`/etc/rkt/auth.d/specific-tectonic.json`:

```json
{
	"rktKind": "auth",
	"rktVersion": "v1",
	"domains": ["tectonic.com"],
	"type": "oauth",
	"credentials": {
		"token": "tectonic-token"
	}
}
```

The result is that when downloading data from `kubernetes.io`, `rkt` still
sends `Authorization: Bearer common-token`, but when downloading from
`coreos.com`, it sends `Authorization: Basic Zm9vOmJhcg==` (i.e. `foo:bar`
encoded in base64). For `tectonic.com`, it will send 
`Authorization: Bearer tectonic-token`.

Note that _within_ a particular configuration directory (either system or
local), it is a syntax error for the same domain to be defined in multiple
files.

### rktKind: `dockerAuth`

This kind of configuration is used to set up necessary credentials when
downloading data from Docker registries. The configuration files should be
placed inside `auth.d` subdirectory (e.g. in `/usr/lib/rkt/auth.d` or
`/etc/rkt/auth.d`).

#### rktVersion: `v1`

##### Description and examples

This version of `dockerAuth` configuration specifies two additional fields:
`registries` and `credentials`.

The `registries` field is an array of strings describing Docker registries for
which the associated credentials should be used. A short list of popular Docker
registries is below. This field must be specified and cannot be empty.

`credentials` field holds the necessary data to authenticate against the
Docker registry. This field must be specified and cannot be empty.

Currently, Docker registries only support basic HTTP authentication, so
`credentials` field has two subfields - `user` and `password`. These
fields must be specified and cannot be empty.

Some popular Docker registries:
* index.docker.io (this is used when no Docker registry is
  specified in a reference on the rkt command line, as in `docker://redis`)
* quay.io
* gcr.io

Example `dockerAuth` configuration:

```json
{
	"rktKind": "dockerAuth",
	"rktVersion": "v1",
	"registries": ["index.docker.io", "quay.io"],
	"credentials": {
		"user": "foo",
		"password": "bar"
	}
}
```

##### Override semantics

Overriding is done for each registry. That means that the user can override
credentials used for each registry. For example, given this system configuration:

In `/usr/lib/rkt/auth.d/docker.json`:

```json
{
	"rktKind": "dockerAuth",
	"rktVersion": "v1",
	"registries": ["index.docker.io", "gcr.io", "quay.io"],
	"credentials": {
		"user": "foo",
		"password": "bar"
	}
}
```

If only this configuration file is provided, then when downloading images from
either `index.docker.io`, `gcr.io`, or `quay.io`, `rkt` would use user `foo` and
password `bar`.

But with additional configuration provided in the local configuration
directory, this can be overridden. For example, given the above system
configuration and the following local configuration:

`/etc/rkt/auth.d/specific-quay.json`:

```json
{
	"rktKind": "dockerAuth",
	"rktVersion": "v1",
	"registries": ["quay.io"],
	"credentials": {
		"user": "baz",
		"password": "quux"
	}
}
```

`/etc/rkt/auth.d/specific-gcr.json`:

```json
{
	"rktKind": "dockerAuth",
	"rktVersion": "v1",
	"domains": ["gcr.io"],
	"credentials": {
		"user": "goo",
		"password": "gle"
	}
}
```

The result is that when downloading images from `index.docker.io`, `rkt` still
sends user `foo` and password `bar`, but when downloading from `quay.io`, it
uses user `baz` and password `quux`; and for `gcr.io` it will use user `goo`
and password `gle`.

Note that _within_ a particular configuration directory (either system or
local), it is a syntax error for the same Docker registry to be defined in
multiple files.
